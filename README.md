# Wikimini

## Problem to solve.

The original application [WikiMini](https://wikimini.org/) was going to be shutdown but after some researches it was found that 40.000 people was using it, it was decided to modernized and improve it.

## Our proposal.

Design and develop a completely new mobile application to make the process of learning as easy and interactive as possible, focused on kids from 6-10 and teenagers from 11-14 years old.
